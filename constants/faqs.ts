    question: "How is this different from SEO?",
    answer:
      "SEO optimizes for search engines with static ranking algorithms. LLMs are dynamic—every conversation is unique based on user context and memory. We optimize for these personalized conversations, not just visibility. Traditional SEO gets you found; we make sure you're recommended.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why should I care about ChatGPT traffic if it's only 20% of my traffic?",
    answer:
      "That 20% is growing 10% month-over-month and these are high-intent users at the decision-making stage. Plus, you're probably undertracking—most LLM traffic appears as 'organic' or 'direct' in your analytics. We help you see the full picture.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to see results?",
    answer:
      "You'll get initial insights within 2 weeks of onboarding. Measurable performance improvements typically appear within 3 months as we implement our optimization plan. This includes content strategy, authority domain partnerships, and AI readiness improvements.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you work with our existing SEO agency?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. We complement traditional SEO strategies. Many of our clients work with SEO agencies—we provide the AI-specific layer that sits on top of their existing efforts. Think of us as the bridge between traditional search optimization and the new world of conversational AI.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is this just for B2C companies?",
    answer:
      "No. B2B financial services (startup insurance, AI protections, corporate lending) are seeing massive traction on LLM platforms for procurement decisions. Decision-makers are using ChatGPT to research vendors, compare solutions, and get recommendations before ever visiting your website.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if ChatGPT mentions us but misrepresents our offer?",
    answer:
      "This is exactly the problem we solve. Visibility alone is meaningless if your offer isn't correctly represented. We analyze how you're being portrayed, identify gaps or inaccuracies, and implement strategies to ensure ChatGPT understands and communicates your unique value proposition accurately.",
  },
