# How ChatGPT is Transforming Financial Services Discovery

The way prospects discover and evaluate financial services has fundamentally changed. ChatGPT and other LLMs are becoming the primary research tool for insurance, lending, and financial services decisions.

## The Invisible Shift

Traditional SEO metrics tell you about Google traffic. But what about the 20%+ of prospects using ChatGPT to research your services? This traffic is invisible to conventional analytics, yet it's growing at 10% monthly.

### What We're Seeing

From our analysis at Google DeepMind and real-world data from companies like Luko (20% ChatGPT traffic before exit to Allianz), we know:

1. **57% of consumers** now use LLMs before making purchase decisions
2. **ChatGPT searches 20+ sources** before generating a response
3. **Only 3-5 sources** actually influence the final recommendation
4. **80% of this process** is completely invisible to you

## Why This Matters for Financial Services

When a prospect asks ChatGPT "What's the best home insurance for young professionals in California?", your company is either in that conversation or losing to competitors who are.

### The Hidden Funnel

Unlike Google where you can track rankings and clicks, ChatGPT operates as a black box:
- No visibility into which sources were considered
- No data on where you ranked
- No insight into why competitors were preferred
- No way to optimize without specialized tools

## The Distribution Intelligence Advantage

At Satsu, we've built systems that decode this hidden funnel. Our approach combines:

- **LLM Expertise**: Understanding how models retrieve and rank information
- **Financial Services Context**: Deep knowledge of insurance, lending, and B2B/B2C dynamics
- **Performance Focus**: Optimizing for conversions, not vanity metrics

## What You Can Do Now

1. **Understand your current ChatGPT footprint** - Are you mentioned? How are you positioned?
2. **Identify drop-off points** - Where in the conversation do prospects choose competitors?
3. **Optimize for AI retrieval** - Make your information LLM-friendly
4. **Track conversion impact** - Measure revenue, not just visibility

The companies that master AI distribution intelligence now will dominate their categories for the next decade. Those that don't risk becoming invisible to an entire generation of AI-first consumers.
